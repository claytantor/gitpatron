##gitpatron Monetizes GitHub with coinbase. 
*Quick and easy donations for open source projects.*
Using gitpatron is like puting a donation box on your open source projects, except the donationas can be targeted to specific issues that patrons would like to see fixed. GitHub is the best place to share code with friends. Coinbase is an international digital wallet that allows you to securely buy, use, and accept bitcoin currency. When you put them together you get an easy and safe way to support your favorite open source projects.


##How does gitpatron work? 
*By letting bitcoin move with the development process.*
The flow of bit coin comes starts from the patron. If a patron wants to donate to a specific issue they would like fixed it is sent to the repo owners wallet. Committers identify which issues they would like to fix, and how much the minimum they should be paid for the fix. Once the fix is made and proof is provided via a github commit id; the repo owner chooses to pay for the full amount that all the patrons have donated. Every contribution and payout is visible to all parties in the process.


##Is gitpatron safe? 
*Sunshine is the best disinfectant.*
Our project is 100% open source that means its safe because we allow our community to critique and improve our security procedures. All commerce is managed via the coinbase API, and we use delegated authority to github using the Oauth2 API an accepted standard for safe user authorization.


##How much money does gitpatron make on a donation? 
*We haven't figured that out yet...*
Money is oxygen for projects. Thats why gitpatron exists. One day we would like to make money, we just havent figured out how to do that in a way that everybody thinks is fair. We will probably spend some time as this gets more mature experimenting with ways to monetize that work for the community. For now just use it to help your project succeed, that's pretty rewarding to us. If we we ever make it too expensive tell us.


##For Patrons
*Be a patron.* And help open source projects thrive.
Github projects need your help. When you support project issues you have a voice in what gets fixed first, and developers are rewarded for their contributions. You only need a bitcoin wallet to contribute to any gitpatron project.


##For Repo Owners
*Repo Owners.* Engage your loyal patrons and give them a voice.
What if your project fans could ask you directly for what they wanted simply by donating? Having a conversation with your patrons about your development road map, and giving them an opportunity to engage directly is like having a compass on the way to your project's success.


##For Committers
*Committers.* Get paid for contributing to the projects you love.
You are a skilled developer with a love for helping open source succeed. You can name your own price for fixes that further the project.
